# textualanalysis

This Shiny app provides a simple interface for exploring and analyzing text data,  
especially useful for UX interview summaries or similar qualitative documents.

Upload one or several .docx files and generate:

- Token tables  
- Keyword-in-context (KWIC) searches  
- Topic modeling (LDA)  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Word frequencies  
- Wordclouds  
- Text co-occurrence networks  
- Correspondence analysis (CA)

All processing runs locally while the app is active — no data is stored or shared.
