# textualanalysis

This Shiny app provides a simple interface for exploring and analyzing text data,  
especially useful for UX interview summaries or similar qualitative documents.

Upload one or several .docx files and generate:

- Token tables  
- Keyword-in-context (KWIC) searches  
- Topic modeling (LDA)  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Word frequencies  
- Wordclouds  
- Text co-occurrence networks  
- Correspondence analysis (CA)

All processing runs locally while the app is active — no data is stored or shared.

## Features

- Token Table: Shows a sample of the document–feature matrix used for further analysis.
- KWIC Search: View how a chosen keyword appears within its surrounding context.
- Topic Modeling (LDA): Identifies recurring themes across your documents.
- Sentiment Analysis: Counts positive and negative terms and computes a positivity ratio.
- Wordcloud: Highlights the most frequent meaningful words.
- Word Frequency Plot: Displays the most common words above a chosen frequency threshold.
- Text Network: Builds a co-occurrence network to show relationships between terms.
- Correspondence Analysis: Maps documents in a 2D space based on vocabulary similarities.
